      <h2>Insurance reimagined
</h2>

      <p>
      The insurance industry is at the heart of digital disruption and convergence. Leading insurers are broadening and diversifying their products and services as they align to meet the changing needs of their clients. This includes investing in customer-facing, cloud-based digital innovations and creating unexpected new ecosystems that serve a broad suite of customer needs. Insurance carriers are also reflecting on their role in society, forging sustainability initiatives and championing diversity in their leadership and agents.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is a critical turning point for the industry, and an opportunity to provide meaningful value for customers, employees and stakeholders. Accenture Insurance has the experience and broad digital expertise to help insurers cultivate agility, creating seamless digital services for customers and new income streams across the business.

      <h2>Insurance Technology Vision</h2>

      <p>
      The metaverse continuum has arrived, merging real-world and virtual personas, properties, and space in the next evolution of the Internet. Enabled by technology and creativity—and underpinned by human and social norms—the metaverse will enable a spectrum of exciting new products, experiences and business models for the insurance industry. It will bring about dramatic changes in how insurers interact with customers, employees and partners; design products and services; and run their businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many of the technologies that the metaverse is being built on aren’t novel, while others represent the cutting edge. But what is revolutionary is the convergence of emerging and maturing technologies in the metaverse—including artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), blockchain, digital twins, edge technologies, cloud, digital currencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), social platforms, ecommerce, and digital marketplaces. As they intersect, these technologies give rise to innovative ways for people and organizations to interact.
